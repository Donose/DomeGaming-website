# DomeGaming-website
This is my first website project for a internet cafe in my town. I made it using basic html/css that i learned in a few weeks. 
It also has basic javascript for responsive design (i know it's not mandatory, but i wanted to give it the hamburger menu) and a basic 5 second auto slide
